The moonlight shines brightly through a window Crack. A window built into the side of a large hollow Oak. Deep underneath the roots the light flows to illuminate a miracle. 

The birth of a child! 

*choice
  #Let me be born!!!
    The beautiful fur of your mother glitters in the sunlight. The only other being in the room tends to her as a midwife. The two ladies expressing a burst of emotion. 
    
    A curious detail however. How would you attribute the physical appearance of your mother? 
    *choice
      #A feline.

      #A mouse.
        *finish
      #A dog.

  #Wait... I'd like to know what's going on first, but quickly. I can't wait in the womb for long.
    Alright then. Where to start!?  
    *choice
      #Accept the terms for now.
        Eventually, the barbarian westerners conquer you anyway, destroying their
        bread basket, and the entire region starves.

      #Threaten to salt our fields if they don't offer better terms.
        They blink.  Your majesty gets a fair price for wheat.
        *finish
  #Wait...I'm lost. Please start from the beginning. The very beginning. With detail. Lots of detail. No one is allowed to die without me knowing first! 
    Alright then. Where to start!?
